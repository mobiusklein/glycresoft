High Energy Glycopeptide Search Tutorial
========================================

This tutorial will cover the steps involved in analyzing glycopeptide
LC-MS/MS data acquired with a high collision energy.

Preparing the Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can download the raw data we will analyze from `20150710_3um_AGP_001.mzML.gz <https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm0uc5q31aaju8s/20150710_3um_AGP_001.mzML.gz?dl=0>`_. Please download it and decompress it.

.. code-block:: bash
	:caption: Deconvolution of Glycopeptide LC-MS/MS

	$ glycresoft mzml preprocess -p 6 -v -a glycopeptide -an peptide 20150710_3um_AGP_001.mzML\
		 20150710_3um_AGP_001.preprocessed.mzML

This will deconvolute the LC-MS run, using six worker processes. This may take a significant
amount of time, on the order of one to two hours.

Building the Search Space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Meanwhile, we can begin setting up the hypothesis. This sample contains predominantly AGP
glycopeptides, so we can start by downloading the AGP protein sequences from UniProt:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ echo P19652 >> accession.txt
	$ echo P02763 >> accession.txt
	$ glycresoft tools download-uniprot -i accession.txt -o agp.fa


Copy the following text into a file "combinatorial-rules.txt"

.. code-block:: text
	:caption: Glycan Combinatorial Rules

	Hex 3 10
	HexNAc 2 9
	Fuc 0 5
	Neu5Ac 0 4

	Fuc < HexNAc
	HexNAc > NeuAc + 1

Next, we'll build the glycan hypothesis

.. code-block:: bash
	:caption: Build glycan hypothesis

	$ glycresoft build-hypothesis glycan-combinatorial combinatorial-rules.txt glycans.db


Now, we'll build the glycopeptide hypothesis using these glycans and the protein
FASTA we downloaded earlier

.. code-block:: bash
	:caption: Build glycopeptide hypothesis

	$ glycresoft build-hypothesis glycopeptide-fa -g glycans.db -s hypothesis -G 1\
	        -u 1 -e trypsin -m 1 -c "Carbamidomethyl (C)" -v "Deamidation (N)"\
	        -v "Pyro-glu from Q (Q@N-term)" -p 4 -n "Alpha-1-acid Glycopeptide Hypothesis"\
	        agp.fa fasta-agp.db

This task should take a few minutes at most.

Search the Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once both the glycopeptide hypothesis is built and the sample is deconvoluted, we can
run the database search:

.. code-block:: bash
	:caption: Database search process

	$ glycresoft analyze search-glycopeptide fasta-agp.db 20150710_3um_AGP_001.preprocessed.mzML 1\
         -o agp-glycopepitdes-20150710_3um_AGP_001.db -p 5


The search process should take between 2 and 10 minutes.

Once the database search process has completed, we can export the search results in CSV format
for downstream analysis.

.. code-block:: bash
	:caption: CSV export

	$ glycresoft export glycopeptide-identification agp-glycopepitdes-20150710_3um_AGP_001.db 1\
	  -o agp-glycopeptides.csv
