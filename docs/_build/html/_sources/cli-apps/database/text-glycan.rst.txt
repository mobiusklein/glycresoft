.. _text-glycan-hypothesis:

Building a Glycan Hypothesis from a Text File
=============================================

When a comprehensive list of glycan compositions is available,
you can translate them into a list encoded in `IUPAClite <../../topics/iupaclite.html>`_
with one composition per line. Lines may have the form

.. code-block:: Text

    <composition>  [<classifier>[  <classifier>...]]
    <composition>  [<classifier>[  <classifier>...]]
    ...

where classifier is one of the recognized glycan composition classifiers
such as ``N-glycan``, ``O-glycan``, or ``GAG-linker``. For more information
on glycan composition classifiers, please see `Glycan Composition Classes <todo>`_.


.. click:: glycan_profiling.cli.build_db:glycan_text
    :prog: glycresoft build-hypothesis glycan-text

For more information on reductions and derivatizations, please see `Glycan Modifications <todo>`_


Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ head glycan-compositions.txt
    {Hex:5; HexNAc:4; Neu5Ac:1}  N-Glycan
    {Hex:5; HexNAc:4; Neu5Ac:2}  N-Glycan
    {Fuc:1; Hex:5; HexNAc:4; Neu5Ac:2}  N-Glycan
    {Fuc:2; Hex:6; HexNAc:5; Neu5Ac:1}  N-Glycan
    {Fuc:1; Hex:6; HexNAc:5; Neu5Ac:2}  N-Glycan

    $ wc -l glycan-compositions.txt
    41 glycan-compositions.txt

    $ glycresoft build-hypothesis glycan-text glycan-compositions.txt glycan-list.db -n "N-Glycan short list"
